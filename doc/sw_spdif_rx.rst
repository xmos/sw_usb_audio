S/PDIF Receive
---------------

XMOS devices can support S/PDIF receive up to 192kHz. 

The S/PDIF receiver module uses a clockblock and a buffered one-bit port. 
The clock-block is divided of a 100 MHz reference clock. The one bit port is buffered to 4-bits.  
The receiver code uses this clock to over sample the input data.  

The receiver outputs audio samples over a *streaming channel end* where data can be input using the
built-in input operator. 

The S/PDIF receive function never returns. The 32-bit value from the channel 
input comprises:

.. list-table:: S/PDIF RX Word Structure
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 32
     
     * - Bits 
       - 
     * - 0:3
       - A tag (see below) 
     * - 4:28
       - PCM encoded sample value
     * - 29:31
       - User bits (parity, etc)

The tag has one of three values:

.. list-table:: S/PDIF RX Tags
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 32
     
     * - Tag
       - Meaning
     * - FRAME\_X
       - Sample on channel 0 (Left for stereo)
     * - FRAME\_Y
       - Sample on another channel (Right if for stereo)
     * - FRAME\_Z
       - Sample on channel 0 (Left), and the first sample of a frame; can be used if the user bits need to be reconstructed.

See S/PDIF specification for further details on format, user bits etc.

Usage and Integration
+++++++++++++++++++++

Since S/PDIF is a digital steam the devices master clock must be syncronised to it. This is typically
done with an external fractional-n multipier. See `Clock Recovery` (:ref:`usb_audio_sec_clock_recovery`)

The S/PDIF receive function communicates with the ``clockGen`` component with passes audio data to the
audio driver and handles locking to the S/PDIF clock source if required (see External Clock Recovery).

Ideally the parity of each word/sample received should be checked.  This is done using the built in 
``crc32`` function (see ``xs1.h``):

.. literalinclude:: lib_xua/lib_xua/src/core/clocking/clockgen.xc
  :start-after: //:badParity
  :end-before: //:

If bad parity is detected the word/sample is ignored, otherwise the tag is inspected for channel 
(i.e. left or right) and the sample stored.

The following code snippet illustrates how the output of the S/PDIF receive component could be used::


  while(1) 
  {
     c_spdif_rx :> data;

     if(badParity(data)
       continue;

     tag = data & 0xF; 

     /* Extract 24bit audio sample */
     sample = (data << 4) & 0xFFFFFF00;

     switch(tag)
     {
       case FRAME_X:
       case FRAME_X:
         // Store left
         break;

       case FRAME_Z:
         // Store right
         break;
     }
  }
