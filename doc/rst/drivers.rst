Driver Support
==============

The XMOS USB Audio Reference design includes support for USB Audio Class (UAC) versions 1.0 and 2.0.  UAC 2.0 includes support for audio over high-speed USB (UAC 1.0 supports full-speed only) and other feature additions.

OS Support for UAC 1.0
----------------------

Support for USB Audio Class 1.0 has been included in macOS and Windows for a number of years. Most Linux distributions also include support.

OS Support for UAC 2.0
----------------------

Support for USB Audio Class 2.0 is only included in more modern versions of macOS and Windows:

    - Since version 10.6.4 macOS natively supports USB Audio Class 2.0
    - Since version 10, release 1809, Windows natively supports USB Audio Class 2.0

Thirds Party Windows Drivers
----------------------------

For some products it may be desirable to use a third-party driver for Windows. A number reasons exist as to why this may be desirable:
    
    - In order to support UAC 2.0 on Windows versions earlier than 10
    - The built-in Windows support is typically designed for consumer audio devices, not for professional audio devices
    - The built in drivers support sound APIs such as WASAPI, DirectSound, MME, but not ASIO.

The XMOS USB Audio Reference design is tested against *Thesycon USB Audio Driver for Windows*. This includes the following 
feature-set/benefits:

    - Available for Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems
    - Designed for professional audio devices and consumer-style devices
    - Supports ASIO for transparent and low-latency audio streaming
    - Supports Windows sound APIs such as WASAPI, DirectSound, MME
    - Supports high-end audio features such as bit-perfect PCM up to 768 kHz sampling rate, native DSD format (through ASIO) up to DSD1024
    - Supports multiple clock sources such as S/PDIF, ADAT or WCLK inputs
    - Supports MIDI 1.0 class, including MIDI port sharing
    - Supports DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) and comes with a GUI utility for firmware update
    - Provides a private API for driver control and direct device communication (SDK available)
    - Comes with a control panel application for driver status/control
    - Optionally supports virtual channels (channels available at ASIO and Windows APIs but not implemented in the device)
    - Optionally supports mixing and/or signal processing plugin in the kernel-mode driver
    - Fully supports driver signing, branding and customization including driver installer (Customization will be done by Thesycon)
    - Technical support and maintenance provided by Thesycon
    - Custom features available on request

.. note::

    Many of the benefits listed above apply to both UAC1.0 and UAC2.0 and the Thesycon Driver supports both class versions. It should
    be noted, however, that XMOS only currently tests UAC1 with built-in drivers.
