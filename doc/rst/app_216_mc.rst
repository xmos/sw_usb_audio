The xcore-200 Multi-Channel Audio Board
=======================================

An application of the USB audio framework is provided specifically for the `XK_AUDIO_216_MC_AB`
hardware described in :ref:`usb_audio_hardware_platforms` and is implemented on an `xcore-200`
series dual tile device. The related code can be found in ``app_usb_aud_xk_216_mc``.

The design supports upto 8 channels of analogue audio input/output at sample-rates up to 192kHz
(assuming the use of I²S). This can be further increased by utilising TDM. It also supports S/PDIF,
ADAT and MIDI input and output as well as the mixing functionalty of ``lib_xua``.

The design uses the following tasks:

 * XMOS USB Device Driver (XUD)
 * Endpoint 0
 * Endpoint Buffer
 * Decoupler
 * AudioHub Driver
 * Mixer
 * S/PDIF Transmitter
 * S/PDIF Receiver
 * ADAT Receiver
 * Clockgen
 * MIDI

The software layout of the USB Audio 2.0 Reference Design running on the
`xcore.ai` device is shown in :numref:`usb_audio_x200_threads`.

Each circle depicts a task running in a single core concurrently with the other tasks. The
lines show the communication between each task.

The ``app_usb_aud_xk_216_mc`` application uses the functions provided in ``lib_board_support``
for master clock generation and audio hardware configuration.
The functions :c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwInit()` and
:c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwConfig()` are called at various points during initialisation and
runtime to initialise and configure the audio hardware.

For further details on the hardware platform and the functions available for configuring it
refer to `lib_board_support <https://www.xmos.com/file/lib_board_support>`_ documentation.

Audio hardware
--------------

Clocking and Clock Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The board includes two options for master clock generation:

    * A single oscillator with a Phaselink PLL to generate fixed 24.576MHz and 22.5792MHz
      master-clocks.
    * A Cirrus Logic CS2100 clock multiplier allowing the master clock to be generated from a
      `xcore` derived reference clock.

The master clock source is controlled by a mux which, in turn, is controlled by bit 5 of `PORT 8C`:

.. list-table:: Master Clock Source Selection
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Value
     - Source
   * - 0
     - Master clock is sourced from PhaseLink PLL
   * - 1
     - Master clock is source from Cirrus Clock Multiplier

The clock-select from the phaselink part is controlled via bit 7 of `PORT 8C`:

.. list-table:: Master Clock Frequency Select
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Value
     - Frequency
   * - 0
     - 24.576MHz
   * - 1
     - 22.579MHz

DAC and ADC
^^^^^^^^^^^

The board is equipped with a single multi-channel audio DAC (Cirrus Logic CS4384) and a single
multi-channel ADC (Cirrus Logic CS5368) giving 8 channels of analogue output and 8 channels of
analogue input. Configuration of both the DAC and the ADC takes place over I²C.


Configuring audio hardware
--------------------------

All of the external audio hardware is configured using ``lib_board_support``.

.. note::

   ``lib_board_support`` has the I²C library (`lib_i2c <www.xmos.com/file/lib_i2c>`_) in its dependency list.

The hardware targeted is the `XMOS XU216 Multichannel Audio board` (`XK-AUDIO-216-MC`).
The functions :c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwInit()` and
:c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwConfig()` are called at various points during initialisation and
runtime to initialise and configure the audio hardware.

The audio hardware configuration is set in the ``config`` structure of type
``xk_audio_216_mc_ab_config_t`` which is passed to the
:c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwInit()` and :c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwConfig()` functions.

.. literalinclude:: ../../app_usb_aud_xk_216_mc/src/extensions/audiohw.xc
  :start-at: static const xk_audio_216_mc_ab_config_t
  :end-at: };

The :c:func:`AudioHwInit()` function is implemented to make a call to the ``lib_board_support``
function :c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwInit()` to power up and initialise the audio hardware
ready for a configuration.

The :c:func:`AudioHwConfig()` function configures the audio hardware post initialisation.
It is called each time a sample rate or stream format change occurs.
It is implemented to make a call to the ``lib_board_support`` function
:c:func:`xk_audio_216_mc_ab_AudioHwConfig()`.

For further details on the hardware platform and the functions available for configuring it
refer to `lib_board_support <https://www.xmos.com/file/lib_board_support>`_ documentation.

Validated build options
-----------------------

The reference design can be built in several ways by changing the build options.
These are described in :numref:`sec_xua_conf_api`.

The design has only been fully validated against the build options as set in the
application as distributed in the CMakeLists.txt.  See :ref:`usb_audio_sec_valbuild` for details
and general information on build configuation naming scheme.

These fully validated build configurations are enumerated in the supplied CMakeLists.txt.

In practise, due to the similarities between the `xcore-200` and `xcore.ai` series feature set,
it is fully expected that all listed `xcore-200` series configurations will operate as expected on
the `xcore.ai` series and vice versa.

The build configuration naming scheme employed in the CMakeLists.txt is shown in
:numref:`table_216_config_naming`.

   * - ADAT output
     - enabled: a
     - disabled: x
   * - DSD output
     - enabled: d
     - disabled: x

e.g. A build configuration named `2AMi10o10xsxxxx` would signify: Audio class 2.0 running in
asynchronous mode. The `xcore` is I²S master.
Input and output enabled (10 channels each), no MIDI, S/PDIF input, no S/PDIF output, no ADAT or DSD.

In addition to this some terms may be appended onto a build configuration name to signify additional
options. For example, `tdm` may be appended to the build configuration name to indicate the I²S
mode employed.
