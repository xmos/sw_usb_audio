        Introduced in mixer optimisations in 6.11.0. Only affects designs using
        mixer functionality.
      + RESOLVED:   (Normal) Audio buffering request system modified such that
        the mixer output is not silent when in underflow case (i.e. host output

      + RESOLVED:   (Normal) Build issue with CODEC_MASTER (xCore is I2S slave)
        enabled
      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) Channel ordering issue in when TDM and CODEC_MASTER
        mode enabled
      + RESOLVED:   (Normal) DFU fails when SPDIF_RX enabled due to clock block
        being shared between SPDIF core and FlashLib

        for higher channel counts including the use of XC unsafe pointers
        instead of inline ASM
      + CHANGE:     Mixer mapping disabled when MAX_MIX_COUNT is 0 since this is
        wasted processing.
      + CHANGE:     Descriptor changes to allow for channel input/output channel
        count up to 32 (previous limit was 18)

6.10.0
------

  * CHANGE:     Support for version 2V0 of XK-USB-AUDIO-U8-2C and XP-SKC-U16
    core boards and XA-SK-USB-BLC and XA-SK-USB-ABC slices in
    app_usb_aud_xk_u8_2c and app_usb_aud_skc_u16_audio8 (previous board versions
    will not operate correctly without software modification)
  * RESOLVED:   (minor) AudioHwConfig() in app_usb_aud_l2 now writes correct
    register value to CS42448 CODEC for MCLK frequencies in the range 25MHz to

    - sc_usb_device: 1.3.4rc0 -> 1.3.5rc2

      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) Design Guide documentation build errors

    - sc_xud: 2.2.3rc0 -> 2.2.4rc3

      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) Potential for lock-up when waiting for USB clock on
        startup. This is is avoided by enabling port buffering on the USB clock
        port. Affects L/G series only.

6.9.0
-----

  * ADDED:    Added ADAT Rx enabled build config in app_usb_aud_l2

  * Changes to dependencies:

    - sc_usb_audio: 6.8.0alpha2 -> 6.9.0alpha0

      + ADDED:      ADAT S-MUX II functionality (i.e. 2 channels at 192kHz) -
        Previously only S-MUX supported (4 channels at 96kHz).
      + ADDED:      Explicit build warnings if sample rate/depth & channel
        combination exceeds available USB bus bandwidth.
      + RESOLVED:   (Major) Reinstated ADAT input functionality, including
        descriptors and clock generation/control and stream configuration
        defines/tables.
      + RESOLVED:   (Major) S/PDIF/ADAT sample transfer code in audio() (from
        ClockGen()) moved to aid timing.
      + CHANGE:     Modifying mix map now only affects specified mix, previous
        was applied to all mixes. CS_XU_MIXSEL control selector now takes values
        0 to MAX_MIX_COUNT + 1 (with 0 affecting all mixes).
      + CHANGE:     Channel c_dig_rx is no longer nullable, assists with timing
        due to removal of null checks inserted by compiler.
      + CHANGE:     ADAT SMUX selection now based on device sample frequency
        rather than selected stream format - Endpoint 0 now configures
        clockgen() on a sample-rate change rather than stream start.

    - sc_usb_device: 1.3.3alpha0 -> 1.3.4rc0

    - sc_xud: 2.2.2alpha0 -> 2.2.3rc0

      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) XUD_ResetEpStateByAddr() could operate on
        corresponding OUT endpoint instead of the desired IN endpoint address as
        passed into the function (and vice versa)

6.8.0
-----

  * ADDED:    Mixer enabled config to app_usb_aud_l2 Makefile
  * ADDED:    Example code for using iAP EA Native Transport endpoints to
    app_usb_aud_skc_u16_audio8

      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) Reverted change in 6.5.1 release where sample rate
        listing in Audio Class 1.0 descriptors was trimmed (previously 4 rates
        were always reported). This change appears to highlight a Windows (only)
        enumeration issue with the Input & Output configs
      + RESOLVED:   (Major) Mixer functionality re-instated, including
        descriptors and various required updates compatibility with 13 tools
      + RESOLVED:   (Major) Endpoint 0 was requesting an out of bounds channel
        whilst requesting level data
      + RESOLVED:   (Major) Fast mix code not operates correctly in 13 tools,
        assembler inserting long jmp instructions
      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) LED level meter code now compatible with 13 tools
        (shared mem access)
      + RESOLVED    (Minor) Ordering of level data from the device now matches
        channel ordering into mixer (previously the device input data and the
        stream from host were swapped)
      + CHANGE:     Level meter buffer naming now resemble functionality

    - sc_usb_device: 1.3.2rc0 -> 1.3.3alpha0

    - sc_xud: 2.2.1rc0 -> 2.2.2alpha0

      + CHANGE:     Header file comment clarification only

6.7.0
-----

  * CHANGE:     Audio interrupt endpoint implementation simplified (use for
    notifying host of clock validity changes) simplified. Decouple() no longer
    involved.
  * RESOLVED:   Makefile issue for 2ioxx config in app_usb_aud_skc_su1
  * RESOLVED:   Support for S/PDIF input reinstated (includes descriptors,
    clocking support etc)

  * Changes to dependencies:

    - sc_usb_audio: 6.6.1rc1 -> 6.7.0alpha0

6.6.1
-----

  * ADDED:      Documentation for DFU
  * ADDED:      XUD_PWR_CFG define
  * CHANGE:     DSD ports now only enabled once to avoid potential lock up on
    DSD->PCM mode change due to un-driven line floating high.
    ConfigAudioPortsWrapper() also simplified.

  * Changes to dependencies:

    - sc_usb_audio: 6.6.0rc2 -> 6.6.1rc1

    - sc_usb_device: 1.3.0rc0 -> 1.3.2rc0

        inter-packet gaps.
      + CHANGE:     Timer usage optimisation - usage reduced by one.
      + CHANGE:     OTG Flags register explicitly cleared at start up - useful
        if previously running in host mode after a soft-reboot.

6.6.0
-----

  * ADDED:      Added app_usb_aud_skc_u16_audio8 application for XP-SKC-U16 with
    XA-SK-AUDIO8
  * CHANGE:     Support for XA-SK-USB-BLC 1V2 USB slice in app_usb_aud_xk_u8_2c
    and app_usb_aud_skc_u16 (1V1 slices will not operate correctly without
    software modification)
  * CHANGE:     Removed app_usb_aud_su1
  * CHANGE:     Endpoint 0 code updated to support new XUD test-mode enable API
  * CHANGE:     Macs operation for volume processing in mixer core now retains
    lower bits when device configured to use either 32bit samples or Native DSD.
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) DFU_FLASH_DEVICE define corrected in
    app_usb_aud_skc_u16. Previously an incorrect SPI spec was defined causing
    DFU to fail for this example application.
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) HID descriptor properly defined when HID_CONTROLS
    enabled

  * Changes to dependencies:

    - sc_usb_audio: 6.5.1rc4 -> 6.6.0rc2

    - sc_usb_device: 1.2.2rc4 -> 1.3.0rc0

      + CHANGE:  Required updates for XUD API change relating to USB

      + ADDED:      Warning emitted when number of cores is greater than 6
      + CHANGE:     XUD no longer takes a additional chanend parameter for
        enabling USB test-modes. Test-modes are now enabled via a
        XUD_SetTestMode() function using a chanend relating to Endpoint 0. This
        change was made to reduce chanend usage only.

6.5.1
-----

  * ADDED:      Added USB Design Guide to this repo including major update (see
    /doc)
  * ADDED:      Added MIDI_RX_PORT_WIDTH define such that a 4-bit port can be
    used for MIDI Rx
  * CHANGE:     I2S data to clock edge setup time improvements when BCLK = MCLK
    (particularly when running at 384kHz with a 24.576MHz master-clock)
  * CHANGE:     String table rationalisation (now based on a structure rather
    than a global array)
  * CHANGE:     Channel strings now set at build-time (rather than run-time)
    avoiding the use of memcpy
  * CHANGE:     Re-added c_aud_cfg channel (guarded by AUDIO_CFG_CHAN) allowing
    easy communication of audio hardware config to a remote core
  * CHANGE:     Channel strings now labeled "Analogue X, SPDIF Y" if S/PDIF and
    Analogue channels overlap (previously Analogue naming took precedence)
  * CHANGE:     Stream sample resolution now passed though to audio I/O core -
    previously only the buffering code was notified. AudioHwConfig() now takes
    parameters for sample resolution for DAC and ADC
  * CHANGE:     Endpoint0 core only sends out notifications of stream format
    change on stream start event if there is an actual change in format (e.g.
    16bit to 24bit or PCM to DSD). This avoids unnecessary audio I/O restarts
    and reconfiguration of external audio hardware (via AudioHwConfig())
  * CHANGE:     All occurances of historical INPUT and OUTPUT defines now
    removed. NUM_USB_CHAN_IN and NUM_USB_CHAN_OUT now used throughout the
    codebase.
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) USB test mode requests re-enabled - previously was
    guarded by TEST_MODE_SUPPORT in module_usb_device (#15385)

    MAX_FREQ (previously based on OUTPUT and INPUT defines) (#15417)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Audio Class 1.0 mute control SET requests stalled due to
    incorrect data length check (#15419)
  * RESOLVED    (Minor) DFU Upload request now functional (Returns current
    upgrade image to host) (#151571)

      + CHANGE:     USB_StandardRequests() now returns XUD_Result_t instead of
        int
      + CHANGE:     app_hid_mouse_demo now uses XUD_Result_t
      + CHANGE:     app_custom_bulk_demo now uses XUD_Result_t
      + CHANGE:     USB_StandardRequests() now takes the string table as an
        array of char pointers rather than a fixed size 2D array. This allows
        for a more space efficient string table representation. Please note,
        requires tools 13 or later for XC pointer support.
      + CHANGE:     Demo applications now set LangID string at build-time
        (rather than run-time)
      + CHANGE:     Test mode support no longer guarded by TEST_MODE_SUPPORT

    - sc_util: 1.0.3rc0 -> 1.0.4rc0

      + module_logging now compiled at -Os
      + debug_printf in module_logging uses a buffer to deliver messages
        unfragmented
      + Fix thread local storage calculation bug in libtrycatch
      + Fix debug_printf itoa to work for unsigned values > 0x80000000

    - sc_xud: 2.0.0beta1 -> 2.0.1rc3

      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) Error when building module_xud in xTimeComposer due
        to invalid project files.

6.5.0
-----

    was a null device
  * CHANGE:     Various changes to use XUD_Result_t returned from XUD functions
  * CHANGE:     All remaining references to ARCH_x defines removed.
    XUD_SERIES_SUPPORT should now be used (#15270)
  * CHANGE:     Added IAP_TILE and MIDI_TILE defines (default to AUDIO_IO_TILE)
    (#15271)
  * CHANGE:     Multiple output stream formats now supported. See
    OUTPUT_FORMAT_COUNT and various _STREAM_FORMAT_OUTPUT_ defines. This allows
    dynamically selectable streaming interfaces with different formats e.g.
    sub-slot size, resolution etc. 16bit and 24bit enabled by default
  * CHANGE:     Audio buffering code now handles different slot size for
    input/output streams
  * CHANGE:     Endpoint 0 code now in standard C (rather than XC) to allow
    better use of packed structures for descriptors
  * CHANGE:     Use of structures/enums/headers in module_usb_shared to give
    more modular Audio Class 2.0 descriptors that can be more easily modified at
    run-time
  * CHANGE:     16bit audio buffer packing/unpacking optimised
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) All access to port32A now guarded by locks in
    app_usb_aud_xk_u8_2c
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) iAP interface string index in descriptors when MIXER
    enabled (#15257)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) First feedback packet could be the wrong size (3 vs 4
    byte) after a bus- speed change. usb_buffer() core now explicitly re-sizes
    initial feedback packet on stream-start based on bus-speed
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Preprocessor error when AUDIO_CLASS_FALLBACK enabled and
    FULL_SPEED_AUDIO_2 not defined. FULL_SPEED_AUDIO_2 now only enabled by
    default if AUDIO_CLASS_FALLBACK is not enabled (#15272)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) XUD_STATUS_ENABLED set for iAP IN endpoints (and
    disabled for OUT endpoint) to avoid potential stale buffer being transmitted
    after bus-reset.

6.4.1
-----

  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI on single-tile L series devices now functional.
    CLKBLK_REF no longer used for MIDI when running on the same tile as
    XUD_Manager()

-----

  * ADDED:      XK-USB-AUDIO-U8-2C mute output driven high when audiostream not
    active (app_usb_aud_xk_u8_2c)
  * CHANGE:     MIDI ports no longer passed to MFi specific functions
  * CHANGE:     Audio delivery core no longer waits for AUDIO_PLL_LOCK_DELAY
    after calling AudioHwConfig() and running audio interfaces. It should be
    ensured that AudioHwConfig() implementation should handle any delays
    required for stable MCLK as required by the clocking hardware.
  * CHANGE:     Delay to allow USB feedback to stabilise after sample-rate
    change now based on USB bus speed. This allows faster rate change at
    high-speed.
  * CHANGE:     FL_DEVICE flash spec macros (from flash.h) used for
    DFU_FLASH_DEVICE define where appropriate rather than defining the spec
    manually
  * RESOLVED:   (Major) Broken (noisy) playback in DSD native mode (introduced
    in 6.3.2). Caused by 24bit (over 32bit) volume processing when DSD enabled -
    DSD bits are lost. 24bit volume control now guarded by NATIVE_DSD define
    (#15200)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Default for SPDIF define set to 1 in app_usb_aud_l1
    customdefines.h. Previously SPDIF not properly enabled in binaries (#15129)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) All remaining references to stdcore[] replaced with
    tile[] (#15122)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Removed hostactive.xc and audiostream.xc from
    app_usb_aud_skc_u16 such that default implementations are used
    (hostactive.xc was using an invalid port) (#15118)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) The next 44.1 based freq above MAX_FREQ was reported by
    GetRange(SamplingFrequency) when MAX_FREQ = MIN_FREQ (and MAX_FREQ was 48k
    based) (#15127)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI input events no longer intermittently dropped under
    heavy output traffic (Typically SysEx) from USB host - MIDI Rx port now
    buffered (#14224)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Fixed port mapping in app_usb_aud_skc_u16 XN file
    (#15124)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) DEFAULT_FREQ was assumed to be a multiple of 48k during
    initial calculation of g_SampFreqMultiplier (#15141)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) SPDIF not properly enabled in any build of
    app_usb_aud_l1 (SPDIF define set to 0 in customdefines.h) (#15102)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) DFU enabled by default in app_usb_aud_l2 (#15153)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Build issue when NUM_USB_CHAN_IN or NUM_USB_CHAN_OUT set
    to 0 and MIXER set to 1 (#15096)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Build issue when CODEC_MASTER set (#15162)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) DSD mute pattern output when invalid DSD frequency
    selected in Native DSD mode. Previously 0 was driven resulting in pop noises
    on the analague output when switching between DSD/PCM (#14769)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Build error when OUT_VOLUME_IN_MIXER was set to 0
    (#10692)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) LR channel swap issue in CS42448 CODEC by more closely
    matching recommended power up sequence (app_usb_aud_l2) (#15189)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Improved the robustness of ADC I2S data port init when
    MASTER_CODEC defined (#15203)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Channel counts in Audio 2 descriptors now modified based
    on bus-speed. Input stream format also modified (previously only output was)
    (#15202)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) Full-speed Audio Class 2.0 sample-rate list properly
    restricted based on if input /output are enabled (#15210)
  * RESOLVED:   (Minor) AUDIO_CLASS_FALLBACK no longer required to be defined
    when AUDIO_CLASS set to 1 (#13302)

  * Changes to dependencies:

    - sc_usb: 1.0.1beta1 -> 1.0.2beta1

      + ADDED:      USB_BMREQ_D2H_VENDOR_DEV and USB_BMREQ_D2H_VENDOR_DEV
        defines for vendor device requests

    - sc_usb_device: 1.0.3beta0 -> 1.0.4beta5

      + CHANGE:     devDesc_hs and cfgDesc_hs params to USB_StandardRequests()
        now nullable (useful for full-speed only devices)
      + CHANGE:     Nullable descriptor array parameters to
        USB_StandardRequests() changed from ?array[] to (?&array)[] due to the
        compiler warning that future compilers will interpret the former as an
        array of nullable items (rather than a nullable reference to an array).
        Note: The NULLABLE_ARRAY_OF macro (from xccompat.h) is used retain
        compatibility with older tools version (i.e. 12).

    - sc_xud: 1.0.2alpha1 -> 1.0.3beta1

      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) ULPI data-lines driven hard low and XMOS pull-up on
        STP line disabled before taking the USB phy out of reset. Previously the
        phy could clock in erroneous data before the XMOS ULPI interface was
        initialised causing potential connection issues on initial startup. This
        affects L/G series libraries only.
      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) Fixes to improve memory usage such as adding missing
        resource usage symbols/elimination blocks to assembly file and inlining
        support functions where appropriate.
      + RESOLVED:   (Minor) Moved to using supplied tools support for
        communicating with the USB tile rather than custom implementation
        (affects U-series lib only).

Legacy release history
----------------------

(Note: USB Audio version numbers unified across all products at this point)

Previous L1 Firmware Releases
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3.3.0
-----
    - ADDED:      Added support for protocol Stall for un-recognised requests to Endpoint 0.
                  BOS Descriptor test in latest version of USB CV test now passes.
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Removed redundant delays in DFU image download.  This aids Windows DFU reliability.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) DFU Run-time descriptors updated from DFU 1.0 to DFU 1.1 spec.  This allows USB CV test pass.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI string descriptors added to string table.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) bInterval value for feedback endpoint modified to be more compatible with Microsoft OSs
                  (support for iso endpoints with bInterval > 8 microframes).  This aids compatibility with 3rd party
                  drivers for USB 3.0 controllers.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Fixed build failure when NUM_USB_CHAN_IN/NUM_USB_CHAN_OUT defined as 0. Previous INPUT/OUTPUT
                  defines now based on NUM_USB_CHAN_XXX defines.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Removed redundant calls to assert() to free memory.


3.2.0
-----
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Fixed reset reliability for self-powered devices.  This was due to an issue with
                  XUD/Endpoint synchronisation during communication of RESET bus state over channels.
                  Bus powered devices should not be effected due to power up on every plug event.
                  Note: Changes limited to XUD library only.

3.1.1
-----
    - RESOLVED    (Major) Removed size in re-interpret cast of DFU data buffer (unsigned to unsigned char). This
                  was due to a new optimisation in the 11.2 compiler which removes part of the DFU buffer (dfu.xc)
                  as it considers it un-used.  This causes the DFU download request to fail due to stack corruption.
3.1.0
-----
    - ADDED:      Re-added LEDA "Valid Host" functionality using VendorHostActive() call. This functionality
                  missing since 3v00.  Note LED now indicated "Valid Host" rather than "Suspend" condition
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Fixed issue when sharing bus with other devices especially high throughput bulk devices
                  (e.g. hard disk drive). This is issue typically caused SOFs to missed by the device
                  resulting in incorrect feedback calculation and ultimately audio glitching.  Note: this effects
                  XUD library only.
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Intermittent issues with device chirp could lead to a bad packet on bus and device not
                  being properly detected as high-speed.  This was due to opmode of transceiver sometimes
                  not being set before chirp. Note: this effects XUD library only.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Intermittent USB CV Test fails with some hub models. Caused by test issuing suspend
                  during resume signalling. Note: this effects XUD library only
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) bMaxPower now set to 10mA (was 500mA) since this is a self-powered design (see
                  SELF_POWERED define)
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Added code to deal with malformed audio packets from a misbehaving driver.
                  Previously this could result in the device audio buffering raising an exception.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) First packet of audio IN stream now correct to current sample-rate.
                  Previously first packet was of length relating to previous sample rate.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI OUT buffering code simplified.  Now a single buffer used instead
                  of previous circular buffer.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Audio OUT stream buffer pre-fill level increased.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Under stressed conditions the Windows built in Audio Class 1.0 driver (usbaudio.sys)
                  may issue invalid sample frequencies (e.g. 48001Hz) leading to an unresponsive device.
                  Additional checks added to cope with this.
