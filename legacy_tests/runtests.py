Tests are performed by running the USB Audio reference design software on
XMOS audio hardware platforms. The audio platform under test will be connected
to both a host PC and set of signal generator and analysis devices to provide
and record audio. Tests are run to test the following features:

    * Analogue audio input
    * Analogue audio output
    * Volume changes on input
    * Volume changes on output
    * Codec as master

The tests are run at sample rates of 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz and
192kHz. Tests utilise all analogue channels of the board simultaneously.
